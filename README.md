## Technologies Used

- **React**: I have used ReactJS for user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling.
- **Ant Design**: I have used it specifically for the Date Picker component and Modal after the booking form is confirmed.
- **React Icons**: I didn't use much of it, mostly tried to use SVG icons made in JSX for better performance, but in some places, I used it.
- **React Hook Form**: Used for form validation to handle the booking form.

## Slider Carousel

A custom slider carousel for the popular food and testimonial section without using any libraries or packages. This allows for smoother performance. The carousel is fully functional and integrates seamlessly with the design.

## Features

- **Booking Form**: The form is fully functional with validation and a confirmation modal, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Tailwind Config**: I have kept the most used styles in the Tailwind config for better maintainability and efficiency.
- **Navbar**: The navbar is sticky, making navigation easy even when scrolling and navbar menubar is also responsive in small device.
- **Image Loading**: I attempted to make the images smaller and used an image CDN for faster loading. However, some images still take time to load, so please wait until the loading is fully complete.

## Youtube video loading

Due to the direct YouTube URLs used. This results in a larger resource and loading time in the network tab, so please keep this in mind while viewing the page.
